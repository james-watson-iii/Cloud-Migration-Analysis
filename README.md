# Cloud-Migration-Analysis
Replatforming Cloud Migration Project <br><br>
The Armor Cases cloud migration project is a strategic initiative to transition from aging on-premises infrastructure to a robust, scalable cloud environment. This project was driven by the need for increased operational efficiency, enhanced security, and compliance with data protection regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and CCPA. The research identified critical objectives, including improved scalability to handle fluctuating e-commerce demand, enhanced disaster recovery capabilities, and long-term cost savings by reducing dependence on physical infrastructure.

The projectâ€™s approach uses a hybrid cloud model, allowing a phased migration that prioritizes non-critical systems initially to minimize disruptions. Key technical elements include auto-scaling for performance during peak periods, load balancing, and cloud-native security measures, such as encryption and identity access management. Regular compliance monitoring ensures data protection standards are consistently met, reinforcing customer and stakeholder trust.

The financial analysis outlined the cost benefits over a five-year span, with savings realized through reduced maintenance expenses, energy efficiency, and optimized resource allocation in the cloud. Estimated long-term savings also include operational flexibility from cloud scalability and a pay-as-you-go model, which enables the company to adjust resources as needed without significant upfront costs.

Ethical practices were integrated into the project plan to uphold data privacy, ensure transparency in AI-based decisions, and promote accountability through structured oversight. The project timeline extends over 12 months, broken into stages: planning, non-critical migration, critical system migration, and full optimization, with continuous monitoring and training for the IT team.

In summary, this migration positions Armor Cases to achieve greater flexibility, security, and resilience, aligning IT infrastructure with business growth and technological advancements to support future scalability and operational stability.
